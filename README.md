## :bulb: Content

This *course* (aka *unit*) delves into the foundational aspects of statistical machine learning, which plays a pivotal role in various areas, including deep learning, data science, data privacy etc. 

The primary focus is on the fundamental learning theories and frameworks of statistical machine learning, and the mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms. The unit concentrates on statistical learning framework, PAC-Learnability, Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), No-Free-Lunch Theory, Non-Uniform Learnability, and Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) etc. Following that, the course shifts attention towards discriminative methods such as common convex optimization techniques, support vector machines, and Kernel methods.


## :ledger: Sessions

Students will have access to a comprehensive range of subject materials, comprising slides handouts, practicals, assessment documents, and relevant readings. It is recommended that students commence their engagement with each session by thoroughly reviewing the pertinent slides handouts and readings to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the content. 

Additionally, students are encouraged to supplement their knowledge by conducting independent research, utilizing online resources or referring to textbooks that cover relevant information related to the topics under study.

### :writing_hand: Practicals

You are recommended to use Cloud platform to run the materials, such as:

- [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com): which will be used in the practical classes.

### :u6e80: Assessment

Every cohort might be assessed differently, depending on the specific requirements of their universities.

The assessment of the unit is mainly aimed at assessing the students' achievement of the unit learning outcomes (`ULOs`, a.k.a. objectives), and checking the students' mastery of those algorithms/models and theory covered in the unit. 

#### :book: Assessment Plan

The detailed assessment specification and marking rubrics can be found at:
[S00D-Assessment](S00-Induction/S00D-Assessment.md). The relationship between each assessment task and the ULOs are shown as follows:

| :microscope: <br> Task  |   :man_teacher: <br> Category |  :dart: <br> [ULO1](S00-Induction/S00C-Logistics.md#ULO1)  | :dart: <br> [ULO2](S00-Induction/S00C-Logistics.md#ULO2) |  :dart: <br> [ULO3](S00-Induction/S00C-Logistics.md#ULO3)  |  Percentage | 
| :----: |  :---: | ------|-------| ----- |  ----- |  
| :one: | Presentation | 50%| 25%  |   25%  | **25%** |  
| :two: | Project |  | 30%  |   70%  |  **50%** |
| :two: | Report <br> Presentation | 20%| 40%  |  40%  |  **25%** |




#### :spiral_calendar: Submission Due Dates

- **SRM 2024** - The final assessment files submissions due date is :spiral_calendar: `Saturday, 18/05/2024` (tentative), group of **one** member only (**individual** work) for all tasks.

It is expected that you will submit each assessment component on time. You will not be allowed to start everything at the last moment, because we will provide you with feedback that you will be expected to use in future assessments.
