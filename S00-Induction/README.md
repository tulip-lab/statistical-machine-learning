# Unit Induction

In this module, you will be introduced to essential information about what the *course* (aka *unit*) on `Statistical Machine Learning` is about, how it is organised, how you will learn, how it is assessed, and what you need to do to get started with your study. It is essential that you work through all information here in order to fully understand how this unit functions.

Let's explore the world of `Statistical Machine Learning` together!

## :ski: Getting Started

In summary, the main message is that the story is about you. You are the learner, so we ask that you participate actively in your own *learning* to achieve your own goals. That does not mean that you also have to do the *teaching* - you can leave that part to us. So have a go at the first module - you should find that things will start to make sense after that.

Also, please remember that we are here to support and guide you, ready to jump in if you have a question - just shout out. You are not on your own.
