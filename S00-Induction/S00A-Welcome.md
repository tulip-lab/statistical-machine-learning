# :clap: Welcome to `Statistical Machine Learning`

Welcome to '*Statistical Machine Learning*', the unit on '*Theoretical Machine Learning*'. In this unit you will have the opportunity to learn basic aspects of statistical learning and related learning scheme, theorems and methods in machine learning. As an advanced unit for motivated students, it is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in the principles and techniques of machine learning, with a focus on the theoretical underpinnings that make these algorithms so powerful.

We will explore a range of critical topics, starting with *Probably Approximately Correct* (PAC) learning. This concept will set the stage for understanding how machine learning algorithms can learn from data and make predictions with a given level of accuracy and confidence. We will dissect the intricacies of sample complexity, which is pivotal in understanding how much data is needed for a machine learning model to be effective.

Another cornerstone of our course will be the exploration of *Vapnik-Chervonenkis* (VC) dimensions. This will provide us with a framework to comprehend the capacity of a machine learning model, balancing the trade-off between complexity and learning ability. Understanding VC dimensions is crucial for grasping why some models perform better than others and how to avoid overfitting. As we progress, we will also cover various algorithms and techniques, each building on our foundational knowledge. You will be challenged with real-world problems, assignments that will not only test your understanding but also enhance your practical skills.


We will discuss the details of the modalities of this unit very soon, but keep in mind that the unit is designed around [`Sessions`](../README.md#Sessions). We would like you to go through the sessions following the [`Recommended Session Schedule`](../README.md#session-plan) at the time of your ease.

I hope you find this unit enjoyable, challenging, and rewarding. The [unit team](S00B-Team.md) is here to help you succeed, and I am looking forward to an exciting course with you all. Together, we will uncover the mysteries of statistical machine learning and equip you with the skills to apply these concepts in innovative ways.

Best wishes
