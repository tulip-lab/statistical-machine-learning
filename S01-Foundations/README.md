# Math Foundations

In this module, a number of foundational concepts and methods related with `Statistical Machine Learning` will be reviewed. Typically, `Probability and Statistics`, `Linear Algebra` are the foundations for statistical machine learning methods. It is essential that you work through all information here in order to fully enjoy the later sessions of this unit.
